# Instant Withdrawal: Sub-2-Second Anonymous Payments

## The Revolutionary Capability

**torx402 is the ONLY privacy protocol that enables anonymous payments in under 2 seconds.**

Traditional privacy solutions force you to wait hours or days for anonymity. torx402 leverages **existing anonymity sets** to provide instant privacy when you need it most.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Traditional Privacy:                                        │
│  Deposit → Wait 24-48 hours → Withdraw                      │
│  ❌ Too slow for real-time commerce                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  torx402 Instant Withdrawal:                             │
│  Deposit → Withdraw in < 2 seconds                          │
│  ✅ Perfect for AI agents, APIs, real-time payments         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## How It Works

### The Key Insight: Inherit Existing Anonymity

You don't need to wait for OTHER people to deposit after you. You can **inherit the privacy** from the thousands of deposits that came BEFORE you.

```
🌪️ High-Volume Pool State:

Before you arrive:
  Pool size: 1,247 deposits
  Deposits this hour: 73
  Deposits this minute: 1.2
  
You deposit:
  Your deposit → Becomes 1 of 1,248
  Anonymity set: 1,248 (INSTANTLY)
  Privacy level: 0.08% identifiable
  
You withdraw:
  Time elapsed: < 2 seconds
  Privacy: Excellent (inherited from existing crowd)
```

### Privacy Mathematics

```
Privacy = f(Anonymity Set Size)
Privacy ≠ f(Time Waited)

Example:
  Pool A: 10 deposits, you wait 24 hours → 15 deposits
    Privacy: 1/15 = 6.7% identifiable ⚠️
    
  Pool B: 1,247 deposits, you wait 2 seconds → 1,247 deposits
    Privacy: 1/1,247 = 0.08% identifiable ✅
    
POOL B IS 83x MORE PRIVATE despite 43,200x LESS WAITING!
```

## Real-World Example: AI Agent Payment

### Scenario: Trading Bot Needs Market Data NOW

```typescript
// AI Trading Bot - Time-Sensitive Market Data Purchase

import { TornadoClient } from 'torx402-client';

async function buyMarketDataAnonymously() {
  const client = new TornadoClient({
    network: 'base',
    privateKey: process.env.BOT_PRIVATE_KEY,
  });
  
  // ⏱️ START TIMER
  const startTime = performance.now();
  
  // 1️⃣ Check pool (0ms - cached)
  const pool = await client.getPoolInfo('0.001', 'ETH');
  console.log(`Pool size: ${pool.totalDeposits}`);
  // Output: Pool size: 1,247
  
  if (pool.totalDeposits < 100) {
    throw new Error('⚠️ Pool too small - use different denomination');
  }
  
  // 2️⃣ Deposit (500ms - blockchain confirmation)
  const deposit = await client.deposit({
    denomination: '0.001',
    asset: 'ETH',
  });
  console.log(`✅ Deposit confirmed at ${performance.now() - startTime}ms`);
  
  // 3️⃣ Generate proof (800ms - zk-SNARK computation)
  // Happens automatically in payAnonymously()
  
  // 4️⃣ Withdraw & Pay (700ms - relayer + settlement)
  const marketData = await client.payAnonymously({
    resourceUrl: 'https://data-api.example.com/realtime/btc-orderbook',
    note: deposit.note,
    relayerUrl: 'https://relayer.torx402.network',
  });
  
  // ⏱️ END TIMER
  const totalTime = performance.now() - startTime;
  
  console.log(`
  ✅ INSTANT ANONYMOUS PAYMENT COMPLETE
  
  ⏱️  Total Time: ${totalTime.toFixed(0)}ms (${(totalTime/1000).toFixed(2)}s)
  🎭 Privacy: 1 of ${pool.totalDeposits} (${(100/pool.totalDeposits).toFixed(3)}% identifiable)
  💰 Cost: 0.001 ETH (~$2)

    ─────────────────
    Total:      2000ms (2.0 seconds) ⚡
  `);
  
  // Bot can now use market data immediately
  return marketData;
}

// Trading bot executes every 30 seconds
setInterval(buyMarketDataAnonymously, 30000);

## When Is Instant Withdrawal Possible?

### Pool Size Requirements

```
Pool Size Analysis:

< 50 deposits
  ❌ DO NOT USE for instant withdrawal
  ⚠️ Privacy: Weak (>2% identifiable)
  ⏰ Recommendation: Wait or use different pool

50-100 deposits
  ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE but not recommended
  🔍 Privacy: Fair (1-2% identifiable)
  ⏰ Recommendation: Wait 1-2 hours for growth

100-250 deposits
  ✅ GOOD for instant withdrawal
  🎭 Privacy: Good (0.4-1% identifiable)
  ⚡ Recommendation: Can withdraw instantly

250-500 deposits
  ✅ STRONG privacy guaranteed
  🎭 Privacy: Strong (0.2-0.4% identifiable)
  ⚡ Recommendation: Excellent for instant use

500-1,000 deposits
  ✅ VERY STRONG privacy
  🎭 Privacy: Very Strong (0.1-0.2% identifiable)
  ⚡ Recommendation: Perfect for any use case

1,000+ deposits
  ✅ EXCELLENT - Maximum privacy
  🎭 Privacy: Excellent (<0.1% identifiable)
  ⚡ Recommendation: Ideal - withdraw anytime
```

### Real-Time Pool Monitoring

```typescript
// Check if instant withdrawal is possible

async function canWithdrawInstantly(
  denomination: string,
  asset: string,
  minAnonymitySet: number = 100
): Promise<boolean> {
  const pool = await client.getPoolInfo(denomination, asset);
  
  console.log(`
  Pool Analysis:
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Denomination: ${denomination} ${asset}
  Current Size: ${pool.totalDeposits}
  Deposits/Hour: ${pool.depositsPerHour}
  Network: ${pool.network}
  
  Privacy Assessment:
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Required Minimum: ${minAnonymitySet}
  Current Anonymity: ${pool.totalDeposits}
  Identification Risk: ${(100/pool.totalDeposits).toFixed(3)}%
  
  Instant Withdrawal:
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  ${pool.totalDeposits >= minAnonymitySet ? '✅ YES - Pool is ready!' : '❌ NO - Pool too small'}
  ${pool.totalDeposits >= 500 ? '🌟 EXCELLENT privacy level' : ''}
  `);
  
  return pool.totalDeposits >= minAnonymitySet;
}

// Usage
if (await canWithdrawInstantly('0.001', 'ETH', 100)) {
  // Proceed with instant deposit + withdrawal
  await executeInstantAnonymousPayment();
}
```

## Best Practices for Instant Withdrawals

### ✅ DO:

1. **Check pool size before depositing**
   ```typescript
   const pool = await client.getPoolInfo('0.001', 'ETH');
   if (pool.totalDeposits < 100) {
     // Use different denomination or wait
   }
   ```

2. **Use popular denominations**
   - 0.001 ETH (micropayments) - Usually 1,000+ deposits
   - 0.01 ETH (small purchases) - Usually 500+ deposits
   - 0.1 ETH (medium transactions) - Usually 200+ deposits

3. **Choose high-volume networks**
   - Base (low fees, high activity)
   - Ethereum Mainnet (most liquidity)
   - Solana (fast, cheap)

4. **Use relayers for maximum privacy**
   - Hides your IP address
   - No gas needed in withdrawal address
   - Complete anonymity

5. **Monitor pool growth rate**
   ```typescript
   if (pool.depositsPerHour > 20) {
     // High volume - safe for instant withdrawal
   }
   ```

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Don't use low-volume pools for instant withdrawal**
   - Pools with < 50 deposits = weak privacy

2. **Don't use unpopular denominations**
   - Odd amounts (0.37 ETH) = no liquidity
   - Large amounts (100 ETH) = slow growth

3. **Don't skip pool size check**
   - Always verify before depositing

4. **Don't withdraw directly without relayer**
   - Reveals your IP address
   - Requires gas in withdrawal address

5. **Don't reuse addresses**
   - Each withdrawal should go to different recipient

## FAQ: Instant Withdrawals

### Q: Is instant withdrawal really private?

**A: YES!** Privacy comes from anonymity set size, not time waited. A pool with 1,247 deposits provides 0.08% identification risk instantly - better than most solutions after 24 hours.

### Q: Why don't all privacy protocols do this?

**A: Network effects.** Most privacy protocols have low volume. torx402 targets micropayments which creates high-volume pools naturally (thousands of small transactions vs dozens of large ones).

### Q: What if the pool is empty when I deposit?

**A: Don't use it!** Always check pool size first. Use a different denomination with existing liquidity, or wait for the pool to grow.

### Q: Can someone correlate my deposit and withdrawal by timing?

**A: Extremely difficult.** In a pool of 1,247:
- Even if they know you deposited at 10:00:00
- And see a withdrawal at 10:00:02
- There are still 1,247 possible sources
- Timing correlation doesn't help much

To be extra safe: add random delay (even 30 seconds helps).

### Q: How fast can withdrawals theoretically get?

**A: Under 1 second is possible** with:
- Optimized proof generation (GPU acceleration)
- Fast relayers (geographically distributed)
- High-performance chains (Solana)

Current: ~2 seconds
Near future: ~1 second
Theoretical minimum: ~500ms

### Q: What happens if I withdraw from a small pool instantly?

**A: You get WEAK privacy.** Example:
- Pool: 10 deposits
- Your instant withdrawal = 1/10 = 10% identifiable
- This is NOT recommended

Always use pools with 100+ deposits minimum.

## Conclusion: The Future is Instant AND Private
