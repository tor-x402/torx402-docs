# Historical Merkle Root Storage

```
Your Commitment in Tree: PERMANENT ✅
  [C0, C1, ... C_yours, ... C9999]
              ↑
              Never removed, always accessible

Root in History Buffer: TEMPORARY (convenience)
  [R0, R1, ... R998, R999]
   ↑
   Eventually overwritten

If root expires: Regenerate proof (5-10 seconds) ✅
No funds lost, no access denied!
```

## The Challenge: Ever-Changing Merkle Roots

### Why Roots Change

Every time someone deposits into a privacy pool, the Merkle tree changes, which means the **Merkle root changes**:

```
Initial State (3 deposits):
  Tree: [C0, C1, C2, 0, 0, 0, ...]
  Root: R0 = hash(hash(C0,C1), hash(C2,0))

After Alice Deposits (C3):
  Tree: [C0, C1, C2, C3, 0, 0, ...]
  Root: R1 = hash(hash(C0,C1), hash(C2,C3))  ← DIFFERENT!

After Bob Deposits (C4):
  Tree: [C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, 0, ...]
  Root: R2 = hash(hash(C0,C1), hash(C2,C3), hash(C4,0))  ← DIFFERENT AGAIN!
```

**Key Insight**: The root changes with every deposit, but **commitments never change**.

### The Withdrawal Challenge

**Scenario:**
```
10:00 AM - You deposit
  Commitment: C_yours at leafIndex 100
  Current Root: R100

10:01 AM - Someone else deposits
  Current Root: R101 (changed!)

10:02 AM - Another deposit
  Current Root: R102 (changed!)

...

10:30 AM - You want to withdraw
  Current Root: R130

Question: Can you still prove your deposit exists?
Answer: YES! Your commitment is still at leafIndex 100
```

## The Solution: Historical Root Buffer

### Root History as a Convenience

The smart contract stores **recent roots** to avoid forcing users to regenerate proofs constantly:

```solidity
contract PrivacyPool {
    // Store last 1,000 Merkle roots in circular buffer
    bytes32[10000] public roots;
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) private rootSet; // O(1) lookup
    uint256 public currentRootIndex = 0;

    function isKnownRoot(bytes32 root) public view returns (bool) {
        return rootSet[root];  // Constant time lookup
    }

    function addRoot(bytes32 newRoot) internal {
        // Remove oldest root from mapping
        bytes32 oldRoot = roots[currentRootIndex];
        if (oldRoot != bytes32(0)) {
            delete rootSet[oldRoot];
        }

        // Add new root to both structures
        roots[currentRootIndex] = newRoot;
        rootSet[newRoot] = true;

        // Circular buffer: wraps around at 10,000
        currentRootIndex = (currentRootIndex + 1) % 10000;
    }
}
```

### How Withdrawals Work

**Case 1: Root Still in History (No Regeneration)**
```
You deposited at 10:00 AM (Root R100)
You withdraw at 2:00 PM (200 deposits later, Current Root R300)

Check: isKnownRoot(R100)?
  → Search in last 10,000 roots
  → R100 found at position 100 ✅
  → Your pre-generated proof is accepted
  → Withdraw immediately

Time: 0 extra seconds
Convenience: Maximum ✅
```

**Case 2: Root Expired from History (Regenerate Proof)**
```
You deposited at 10:00 AM (Root R100)
You withdraw 2 weeks later (1,500 deposits later, Current Root R1600)

Check: isKnownRoot(R100)?
  → Search in last 10,000 roots
  → R100 NOT found (evicted at deposit 10,100)
  → Your pre-generated proof is rejected

BUT your commitment is still at leafIndex 100! ✅

Solution:
  1. Fetch current root R1600
  2. Fetch Merkle proof for leafIndex 100
  3. Generate new zk-SNARK proof (5-10 seconds)
  4. Submit new proof
  5. Withdraw successfully ✅

Time: 5-10 seconds extra (one-time)
Funds status: SAFE, fully accessible ✅
```

## Why 10,000 Roots? (Not 30, 100, or 1,000)

### Comparison of Options

| Roots | Storage | Gas Cost | Time Window (10k deposits/hr) | Regeneration Frequency | Verdict |
|-------|---------|----------|----------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| **30** (Tornado) | 960 B | ~6k gas | ~2 minutes | Constant | ❌ Far too short |
| **100** | 3.2 KB | ~20k gas | ~6 minutes | Very often | ❌ Too short |
| **1,000** | 32 KB | ~3k gas | ~6 minutes | Very often | ⚠️ Still too tight |
| **10,000** ✅ | **320 KB** | **~3k gas** | **~1 hour** | **Occasional** | ✅ **OPTIMAL** |

### Volume Assumptions & Time Windows

**Conservative Volume Estimates** (per denomination pool):
- High Volume: 10,000 deposits/hour (primary target)
- Very High Volume: 100,000 deposits/hour (peak scenario)
- Medium Volume: 1,000 deposits/hour (slower pools)
- Low Volume: 100 deposits/hour (large denominations)

**Time Windows by Volume:**

```
High Volume (10,000 deposits/hour) - Target Scenario:
  30 roots (Tornado): ~2 minutes ❌
  10,000 roots (torx402): ~1 hour ✅
  → Sufficient for normal withdrawal patterns
  
Very High Volume (100,000 deposits/hour) - Peak Scenario:
  30 roots: ~11 seconds ❌
  10,000 roots: ~6 minutes ✅
  → Still workable with auto-regeneration
  
Medium Volume (1,000 deposits/hour):
  30 roots: ~2 minutes ❌
  10,000 roots: ~10 hours ✅
  → Covers sleep, work, full day
  
Low Volume (100 deposits/hour):
  30 roots: ~18 minutes ⚠️
  10,000 roots: ~4+ days ✅
  → Plenty of time
```

### Why Not More (100k or 1M)?

**Diminishing Returns:**
```
10,000 roots: ~1 hour at 10k deposits/hour ✅
  → Covers: Normal withdrawal timing
  → Storage: 320 KB (reasonable)
  
100,000 roots: ~10 hours at 10k deposits/hour
  → Covers: Full day including sleep
  → Storage: 3.2 MB (getting expensive)
  → Benefit: Avoids regeneration for slow withdrawers
  → Cost: 10x storage
  
1,000,000 roots: ~100 hours at 10k deposits/hour
  → Covers: 4+ days
  → Storage: 32 MB (very expensive on-chain)
  → Benefit: Minimal (who waits 4 days?)
  → Cost: 100x storage
  
Verdict: 10,000 roots is the sweet spot
```

**Design Philosophy**: 
- At 10k deposits/hour (conservative): 1 hour window is sufficient
- At 100k deposits/hour (very high): 6 minute window requires auto-regeneration
- SDK will handle regeneration automatically
- Proof regeneration only takes 5-10 seconds
- Better to regenerate occasionally than waste storage

## Gas Cost Optimization: The Mapping Trick

### Naive Implementation (Don't Use)

```solidity
// O(n) iteration - expensive for large arrays
function isKnownRoot(bytes32 root) public view returns (bool) {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        if (roots[i] == root) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

Gas cost: 1,000 iterations × ~200 gas = ~200,000 gas ❌
```

### Optimized Implementation (Use This)

```solidity
// O(1) mapping lookup - constant time
contract PrivacyPool {
    bytes32[10000] public roots;  // Historical record
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) private rootSet;  // Fast validation

    function isKnownRoot(bytes32 root) public view returns (bool) {
        return rootSet[root];  // Single lookup!
    }
}

Gas cost: Single mapping read = ~3,000 gas ✅
```

**Result**: Mapping makes 1,000 roots CHEAPER than iterating through 100 roots!

### Storage Management

```solidity
function addRoot(bytes32 newRoot) internal {
    // Step 1: Remove oldest root from mapping
    bytes32 oldRoot = roots[currentRootIndex];
    if (oldRoot != bytes32(0)) {
        delete rootSet[oldRoot];  // ~5k gas (storage refund)
    }

    // Step 2: Add new root to both structures
    roots[currentRootIndex] = newRoot;  // ~20k gas
    rootSet[newRoot] = true;  // ~20k gas

    // Step 3: Advance circular buffer pointer
    currentRootIndex = (currentRootIndex + 1) % 1000;

    // Total: ~45k gas per deposit
}
```

## Proof Regeneration: Simple & Automatic

### When Do You Need to Regenerate?

```
High-volume pool (100 deposits/hour):
  1,000 roots = 10 hour window

If you withdraw within 10 hours: No regeneration needed ✅
If you withdraw after 10+ hours: Regenerate (5-10 sec) ⚠️

Likelihood:
  - Same day withdrawal: 95% no regeneration
  - Next day withdrawal: 80% no regeneration
  - Week later: 0% (regeneration needed)
```

### The Regeneration Process

```typescript
// SDK handles this automatically
async function withdraw(note) {
  // 1. Check if root is still valid
  const rootValid = await pool.isKnownRoot(note.root);

  if (rootValid) {
    // Fast path: Use existing proof
    console.log('✅ Using cached proof');
    return await submitWithdrawal(note.proof);
  } else {
    // Regenerate path: Takes 5-10 seconds
    console.log('⏳ Root expired, regenerating proof...');

    // Your commitment is still at the same leafIndex!
    const currentState = await pool.getMerkleTreeState();
    const merkleProof = currentState.getProof(note.leafIndex);

    // Generate new zk-SNARK proof with current root
    const newProof = await generateZKProof({
      nullifier: note.k,
      secret: note.r,
      leafIndex: note.leafIndex,
      merkleProof: merkleProof,
      root: currentState.root,  // Use current root
      recipient: merchantAddress,
      relayer: relayerAddress,
      fee: relayerFee,
    });

    console.log('✅ New proof generated');
    return await submitWithdrawal(newProof);
  }
}

// User experience: Transparent, automatic
// Time penalty: 5-10 seconds (only if root expired)
// Financial cost: $0
```

## Why Tornado Cash Used 30 Roots

### Original Tornado Cash Design (2019)

**Actual Tornado Cash Specifications:**
- **Root storage**: 30 roots (not 100!)
- **Tree height**: 32 (same as torx402)
- **Lookup method**: Linear iteration through 30 roots
- **Gas cost**: ~6,000 gas for root lookup

```
Target use case: Large, infrequent transfers
  - Pools: 0.1 ETH, 1 ETH, 10 ETH, 100 ETH
  - Volume: 5-20 deposits per hour (low frequency)
  - User behavior: Deposit large sum, withdraw days/weeks later
  
30 roots calculation:
  Medium pool (10 deposits/hour): 30 roots = 3 hours ✅
  Low pool (5 deposits/hour): 30 roots = 6 hours ✅
  
Verdict: 30 roots was SUFFICIENT for large, low-frequency pools ✅

Why it worked:
  - Low volume (5-20/hour, not thousands)
  - Users expected to wait days for anonymity anyway
  - 3-6 hour window was plenty
  - Regeneration was rare
  
Source: Tornado Cash uses incremental Merkle tree of height 32
        with last 30 root snapshots for verification
```

## Why torx402 Uses 1,000 Roots

### Target Use Case: High-Volume Micropayments

**torx402 Specifications:**
- **Root storage**: 10,000 roots (333x more than Tornado)
- **Tree height**: 32 (same as Tornado - proven design)
- **Lookup method**: Mapping (O(1), constant time)
- **Gas cost**: ~3,000 gas (50% cheaper than Tornado!)
- **Target networks**: Layer 2s (Base, Arbitrum), BSC, Solana

```
Target use case: Frequent, small payments (micropayments)
  - Pools: 0.001 ETH, 0.01 ETH, 0.1 ETH (small denominations)
  - Volume: 10,000 deposits/hour (conservative estimate)
  - Peak volume: 100,000+ deposits/hour (AI agents, global usage)
  - User behavior: Deposit and withdraw within hours, constant AI agent activity
  
10,000 roots calculation (conservative 10k deposits/hour):
  High volume pool: 10,000 ÷ 10,000 = ~1 hour window ✅
  
10,000 roots calculation (peak 100k deposits/hour):
  Very high volume: 10,000 ÷ 100,000 = ~6 minutes ⚠️
  → Auto-regeneration in SDK handles this
  
Verdict: 10,000 roots provides ~1 hour window at target volume ✅

Why we need 333x more than Tornado:
  - MUCH higher volume (10k/hr vs 5-20/hr = 500-2000x more)
  - Micropayments = constant high-frequency usage
  - AI agents operating 24/7 globally
  - Users still need reasonable time to withdraw
  - L2 gas is cheap enough to afford more storage
```

### The Design Philosophy

```
Tornado Cash (30 roots, height 32):
  Philosophy: "Users wait days for anonymity anyway"
  Use case: Large amounts (1-100 ETH), patience expected
  Volume: 5-20 deposits/hour (low frequency)
  Window: 1.5-6 hours (sufficient for low volume)
  Networks: Ethereum mainnet (expensive gas)
  
torx402 (10,000 roots, height 32):
  Philosophy: "High-frequency micropayments need reasonable windows"
  Use case: Micropayments (0.001-0.1 ETH), instant usage
  Volume: 10,000 deposits/hour (conservative) to 100,000+ (peak)
  Window: ~1 hour (conservative) to ~6 minutes (peak)
  Networks: L2s (Base, Arbitrum), BSC, Solana (cheap gas)
  
Both are correct for their use case!
torx402 scales for 500-2000x higher volume than Tornado
```

## Technical Details

### Circular Buffer Implementation

```solidity
contract PrivacyPool {
    // Dual storage for efficiency
    bytes32[10000] public roots;           // Array: historical record
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) private rootSet;  // Mapping: fast lookup
    uint256 public currentRootIndex = 0;
    uint32 public constant TREE_HEIGHT = 32;  // Supports 4.3B deposits

    // Add new root (called on each deposit)
    function addRoot(bytes32 newRoot) internal {
        // Evict oldest root from mapping
        bytes32 oldRoot = roots[currentRootIndex];
        if (oldRoot != bytes32(0)) {
            delete rootSet[oldRoot];
        }

        // Add new root to both structures
        roots[currentRootIndex] = newRoot;
        rootSet[newRoot] = true;

        // Advance pointer (circular)
        currentRootIndex = (currentRootIndex + 1) % 10000;
    }

    // Validate root (O(1) constant time)
    function isKnownRoot(bytes32 root) public view returns (bool) {
        return rootSet[root];
    }

    // Withdraw function checks root validity
    function withdraw(
        uint[2] memory a,
        uint[2][2] memory b,
        uint[2] memory c,
        bytes32 root,
        bytes32 nullifierHash,
        address payable recipient,
        address payable relayer,
        uint256 fee
    ) external nonReentrant {
        // Verify root is in recent history
        require(isKnownRoot(root), "Unknown Merkle root");

        // Verify zk-SNARK proof
        require(
            verifier.verifyProof(a, b, c, [uint256(root), uint256(nullifierHash), ...]),
            "Invalid proof"
        );

        // Check nullifier not used
        require(!nullifierHashes[nullifierHash], "Already withdrawn");
        nullifierHashes[nullifierHash] = true;

        // Transfer funds
        recipient.transfer(DENOMINATION - fee);
        if (fee > 0) relayer.transfer(fee);

        emit Withdrawal(recipient, nullifierHash, relayer, fee);
    }
}
```

### Gas Cost Analysis

```
Per Deposit (add root):
  Delete old mapping entry: ~5,000 gas
  Add new mapping entry: ~20,000 gas
  Update array slot: ~20,000 gas
  ────────────────────────────────
  Total: ~45,000 gas
  Cost on Base L2 (0.1 gwei): ~$0.0001
  Cost on BSC (3 gwei): ~$0.003
  Cost on Solana: ~$0.00001

Per Withdrawal (check root):
  Mapping lookup: ~3,000 gas
  ────────────────────────────────
  Total: ~3,000 gas (vs ~200k for iteration!)

Total Withdrawal Cost (Height 32 tree):
  Proof verification (32 hashes): ~400,000 gas
  Root lookup (mapping): ~3,000 gas
  Nullifier check: ~5,000 gas
  Transfers: ~50,000 gas
  ────────────────────────────────
  Total: ~458,000 gas
  
Root overhead: < 1% of total cost ✅

Cost on Target Networks:
  - Base L2 (0.1 gwei): ~$0.0001
  - Arbitrum (0.1 gwei): ~$0.0001
  - BSC (3 gwei): ~$0.003
  - Solana: ~$0.00001
```
```

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Usage (No Regeneration)

```
User deposits 0.01 ETH at 9:00 AM
Pool: 10,000 deposits/hour (high volume - conservative)
Window: 10,000 roots = ~1 hour

Timeline:
  9:00 AM - Deposit (Root R5000)
  9:30 AM - 5,000 more deposits (Root R10000)
  10:00 AM - User withdraws
  
Check: isKnownRoot(R5000)?
  → YES (only 1 hour, 10,000 deposits elapsed, still in window)
  → Pre-generated proof accepted ✅
  → Instant withdrawal

User experience: Seamless, no delays
```

### Scenario 2: Peak Volume (Regeneration Needed)

```
AI agent deposits 0.001 ETH at 10:00 AM
Pool: 100,000 deposits/hour (peak volume scenario)
Window: 10,000 roots = ~6 minutes
Window: 10,000 roots = ~6 minutes

Timeline:
  Monday 10:00 AM - Deposit (Root R50000)
  Monday 10:10 AM - Root R50000 evicted (10,000+ new deposits)
  Monday 10:15 AM - User tries to withdraw
  
Check: isKnownRoot(R50000)?
  → NO (15 minutes elapsed, 25,000 deposits)
  → Pre-generated proof rejected

SDK automatically regenerates:
  1. Fetch current root R66666
  2. Fetch Merkle proof for leafIndex 50000
     (commitment still there!)
  3. Generate new proof (5-10 seconds)
  4. Submit and withdraw ✅
  
User experience: 5-10 second delay, no funds lost
Message: "Root expired, regenerating proof... done! ✅"
Note: At 100k/hour peak, auto-regeneration is expected and handled seamlessly
Message: "Root expired, regenerating proof... done! ✅"
Note: At very high volume (100k/hour), auto-regeneration may be frequent
```

### Scenario 3: Extreme Edge Case (Still Works!)

```
User deposits and forgets for 6 months
Pool has 100,000+ deposits now

Timeline:
  January 1 - Deposit (Root R1000, leafIndex 1000)
  July 1 - User remembers and withdraws

Check: isKnownRoot(R1000)?
  → NO (100,000 deposits later!)

Solution: Regenerate proof
  1. Fetch current tree state
  2. Commitment STILL at leafIndex 1000 ✅
  3. Generate proof with current root (5-10 seconds)
  4. Withdraw successfully ✅

User experience: 5-10 second delay after 6 months
Funds: Completely safe ✅
```

## Why Root History Doesn't Lock Funds

### The Key Distinction

```
Merkle Tree (THE SOURCE OF TRUTH):
  - Contains ALL commitments from ALL deposits
  - Commitments NEVER removed
  - Grows monotonically (never shrinks)
  - Your leafIndex is PERMANENT

  Your commitment at leafIndex 1000:
    Tree: [... C999, C1000 (yours), C1001, ...]
    Status: PERMANENT - never removed ✅

Root History (CONVENIENCE CACHE):
  - Contains RECENT roots only
  - Roots ARE removed (circular buffer)
  - Used to accept pre-generated proofs
  - NOT required for withdrawal

  Your root R1000:
    History: [... R999, R1000, R1001, ...]
    Status: TEMPORARY - will be evicted
    Effect: Must regenerate proof (5-10 sec)
    NOT: "Funds locked" ❌
```

### What the Contract Actually Checks

```solidity
function withdraw(..., bytes32 root, ...) external {
    // Check 1: Is root in recent history?
    require(isKnownRoot(root), "Unknown Merkle root");
    // ↑ This is just checking your PROOF is recent
    //   NOT checking your COMMITMENT exists

    // Check 2: Does the proof verify?
    require(verifyProof(...), "Invalid proof");
    // ↑ This verifies you know secrets (k,r)
    //   that produce a commitment in the tree
    //   at some leafIndex that hashes to this root

    // Check 3: Not already withdrawn?
    require(!nullifierHashes[nullifierHash], "Already withdrawn");

    // All checks pass → Withdraw ✅
}
```

**Key Point**: The contract checks if your **proof is recent**, not if your **commitment exists**. Your commitment existing is proven by the zk-SNARK, which you can regenerate anytime!

## Comparison to Tornado Cash

### Tornado Cash (Original, 2019)

**Actual Specifications:**
```
Root storage: 30 roots
Tree height: 32 (4.3 billion capacity)
Lookup method: Linear iteration (do-while loop)
Gas cost: ~6,000 gas
Target pools: 0.1, 1, 10, 100 ETH (large denominations)
Volume: 5-20 deposits/hour (low frequency)
Time window: 1.5 to 6 hours at typical volume

Design rationale:
  ✅ Sufficient for low-volume pools
  ✅ Users expected to wait days anyway
  ✅ Minimal storage (960 bytes)
  ✅ 2019 gas prices were high

Verdict: Perfect for their use case ✅
```

### torx402 (2024+)

**torx402 Specifications:**
```
Root storage: 10,000 roots (333x more than Tornado)
Tree height: 32 (same as Tornado - proven design)
Lookup method: Mapping (O(1), optimized)
Gas cost: ~3,000 gas (50% cheaper than Tornado!)
Target pools: 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 ETH (micropayments)
Volume (conservative): 10,000 deposits/hour (500-2000x more than Tornado)
Volume (peak): 100,000+ deposits/hour (AI agents, global usage)
Time window: ~1 hour at conservative volume, ~6 min at peak

Design rationale:
  ✅ Micropayments generate 500-2000x higher volume than large transfers
  ✅ Need 333x more roots to maintain usable time windows
  ✅ L2s/BSC/Solana have cheap gas (can afford more storage)
  ✅ Mapping optimization makes 10k roots cheaper than Tornado's 30
  ✅ Height 32 provides 4.3B capacity (sufficient for years of growth)
  ✅ 1 hour window at target volume is reasonable
  ✅ Auto-regeneration handles peak scenarios
  
Verdict: Optimized for high-frequency micropayment use case ✅
```

## Best Practices

### For Users

**✅ DO:**
1. **Withdraw within the window** (~1 hour for target volume)
2. **Trust auto-regeneration** - SDK handles expired roots automatically
3. **Save your note securely** - you need (k, r, leafIndex)
4. **Check pool volume** before depositing
5. **Use pools on L2s/BSC/Solana** - cheaper gas for height 32 proofs

**❌ DON'T:**
1. Worry about "losing funds" - impossible if you have your note
2. Rush to withdraw - you have hours/days
3. Generate proof weeks in advance - might need regeneration

### For Developers

**✅ DO:**
1. **Implement automatic regeneration** in SDK
   ```typescript
   if (!isKnownRoot(note.root)) {
     await regenerateProof(note);
   }
   ```

2. **Show time remaining** to users
   ```typescript
   const rootAge = await pool.getRootAge(note.root);
   console.log(`Root valid for ${1000 - rootAge} more deposits`);
   ```

3. **Educate users** that regeneration is safe
   ```typescript
   console.log('Root expired, regenerating proof (5-10 sec)...');
   console.log('Your funds are safe! ✅');
   ```

**❌ DON'T:**
1. Show scary error messages about "expired roots"
2. Make regeneration seem like a failure
3. Require manual regeneration (automate it!)

## FAQ

### Q: What if my root expires?

**A**: No problem! Just regenerate your proof with the current root. Takes 5-10 seconds. Your commitment is still in the tree at the same position.

### Q: Can I lose my funds if I wait too long?

**A**: NO! Your commitment is permanent in the height 32 Merkle tree. You can always withdraw by regenerating the proof, even years later (assuming you have your secrets k and r). The tree can hold 4.3 billion deposits - it will never fill in any realistic timeframe.

### Q: Why not just store all roots forever?

**A**:
- After 1 million deposits: 32 MB storage, ~$10,000 gas per withdrawal
- Not practical or necessary
- Regeneration is cheap (5-10 seconds)
- 1,000 roots covers 99%+ of normal usage

### Q: What if the Merkle tree gets corrupted?

**A**: The tree state is reconstructable from blockchain events. Anyone can rebuild it. Your commitment is in the blockchain permanently.

### Q: How does this compare to Tornado Cash?

**A**: 
- **Tornado Cash**: 30 roots, height 32, 5-20 deposits/hour
- **torx402**: 10,000 roots, height 32, 10,000+ deposits/hour
- torx402 needs 333x more roots due to 500-2000x higher volume
- Both designs are optimal for their respective use cases
- Height 32 is industry standard (Tornado Cash proven design since 2019)

## Summary

**Root History: A Convenience, Not a Constraint**

```
✅ Stores last 10,000 Merkle roots (333x more than Tornado's 30)
✅ Height 32 tree (4.3 billion capacity, same as Tornado)
✅ Provides ~1 hour window at 10k deposits/hour (target volume)
✅ Efficient O(1) lookup (~3k gas via mapping)
✅ Reasonable storage (320 KB - acceptable on L2s)
✅ Funds NEVER locked (can always regenerate)
✅ Optimal for high-frequency micropayment use case
✅ Deployed on L2s, BSC, Solana (cheap gas for height 32)
```

**Key Takeaways:**

1. Your commitment is **permanent** (never removed from height 32 tree)
2. Root history is **temporary** (convenience window)
3. Expired root = **regenerate proof** (5-10 seconds, automatic in SDK)
4. 10,000 roots = **optimal balance** for high-volume micropayments
5. Height 32 tree = **4.3 billion capacity** (effectively unlimited)
6. Funds are **always accessible** (mathematically guaranteed)
7. Target networks (L2s, BSC, Solana) make height 32 affordable

**This design enables fast, convenient withdrawals while maintaining security and efficiency.** 🎯
